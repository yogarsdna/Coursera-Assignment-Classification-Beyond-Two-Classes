# Coursera Assignment - Classification Beyond Two Classes

This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow course in the week 4 section where it discusses Multiclass Classifications. This assignment is about working on a multi-class classification problem. Where we will be using the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the English alphabet. And we will need to pre-process the data so that it can be fed into our convolutional neural network to correctly classify each image as the letter it represents.
